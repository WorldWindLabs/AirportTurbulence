## üéØ Video Structure (Estimated 15 minutes)

### Introduction (1 minute)
**Script:**
"Hi everyone! Today we're going to set up an amazing 3D airport turbulence visualization system. By the end of this video, you'll have a beautiful interactive globe showing real-time weather data from airports around the world. Don't worry if you've never done this before - I'll walk you through every single step!"

**Show on screen:**
- Final application running
- 3D globe with turbulence data
- Quick preview of features

### Prerequisites Check (2 minutes)

#### Segment 1: Computer Requirements
**Script:**
"First, let's make sure your computer is ready. You'll need:
- Any Windows, Mac, or Linux computer
- Internet connection 
- About 1-2 hours of time
- And most importantly - curiosity and patience!"

#### Segment 2: What We're Building
**Script:**
"Here's what we're building: a full-stack web application that fetches real weather data from aviation websites, processes it to calculate turbulence levels, and displays it on a 3D interactive globe. Pretty cool, right?"

**Show on screen:**
- Architecture diagram
- Data flow visualization

---

### Python Installation (3 minutes)

#### Segment 1: Download Python
**Script:**
"Step one: we need Python, the programming language that powers our weather data processing. Go to python.org/downloads and click the big yellow download button."

**Screen recording:**
- Navigate to python.org
- Show download button
- Download installer

#### Segment 2: Install Python
**Script:**
"When you run the installer, THE MOST IMPORTANT THING is to check this box that says 'Add Python to PATH'. This is super important - don't skip it!"

**Screen recording:**
- Run installer
- Highlight PATH checkbox
- Complete installation

#### Segment 3: Test Installation
**Script:**
"Let's test that Python installed correctly. Open your Command Prompt - on Windows, press Win+R, type 'cmd', and press Enter. Then type 'python --version' and you should see something like Python 3.12."

**Screen recording:**
- Open command prompt
- Type python --version
- Show successful output

---

### Project Setup (3 minutes)

#### Segment 1: Download Project
**Script:**
"Next, we need the project files. Go to the GitHub page, click the green Code button, and download ZIP. Extract it to your Desktop and rename the folder to 'AirportTurbulenceAnalysis' to make it easier to work with."

**Screen recording:**
- Navigate to GitHub
- Download ZIP
- Extract and rename

#### Segment 2: Navigate to Project
**Script:**
"Now in your Command Prompt, we need to navigate to our project folder. Type 'cd Desktop/AirportTurbulenceAnalysis/Workspace' - adjust the path if you put it somewhere else."

**Screen recording:**
- Navigate to project folder
- Show directory contents

---

### Install Dependencies (2 minutes)

**Script:**
"Time to install the Python libraries we need. These are like toolboxes with pre-written code. Type 'pip install flask flask-cors requests' and press Enter. You'll see lots of text scrolling by - that's normal! This might take a minute or two."

**Screen recording:**
- Run pip install command
- Show installation progress
- Highlight successful completion

**Troubleshooting note:**
"If you get an error saying 'pip is not recognized', try 'python -m pip install flask flask-cors requests' instead."

---

### Database Setup (1 minute)

**Script:**
"Now we need to set up our database to store airport and weather information. Type 'python backend/init_db.py' and you should see 'Database initialized successfully!'"

**Screen recording:**
- Run database initialization
- Show success message
- Briefly explain what happened

---

### Get Weather Data (1 minute)

**Script:**
"Let's fetch some real weather data! Type 'python backend/weather.py' and wait. This connects to aviation weather websites and downloads current conditions. It might take 30-60 seconds, so be patient!"

**Screen recording:**
- Run weather.py
- Show data fetching progress
- Highlight completion message

---

### Start the Servers (2 minutes)

#### Segment 1: Backend Server
**Script:**
"Now for the exciting part - starting our servers! Keep this Command Prompt window open and open a NEW one. In the new window, navigate to your project folder again and type 'python backend/app.py'. You should see 'Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000'. This is our backend server - it's like a waiter that serves data to our website."

**Screen recording:**
- Open new terminal
- Navigate to project
- Start backend server
- Show success message

#### Segment 2: Frontend Server
**Script:**
"Open ONE MORE Command Prompt window - so you have 3 total now. Navigate to the frontend folder with 'cd Desktop/AirportTurbulenceAnalysis/Workspace/frontend', then type 'python -m http.server 8080'. This starts our website server."

**Screen recording:**
- Open third terminal
- Navigate to frontend
- Start frontend server
- Show all three terminals running

---

### The Big Reveal (1 minute)

**Script:**
"The moment of truth! Open your web browser and go to 'localhost:8080'. Wait for it to load - the first time takes 10-15 seconds as it downloads the 3D globe graphics."

**Screen recording:**
- Open browser
- Navigate to localhost:8080
- Show loading process
- REVEAL the working application!

**Script continues:**
"And there it is! A beautiful 3D Earth with real-time turbulence data! You can drag to rotate, scroll to zoom, and click on airports for detailed weather information. The red circles show high turbulence, yellow is moderate, and green is light. You just built a professional-grade data visualization application!"

---

### How to Use & Wrap Up (1 minute)

**Script:**
"Let me quickly show you how to use this. Drag the globe to rotate it, use your mouse wheel to zoom, and click on any airport marker to see detailed weather information. The control panel on the right shows different airports and their turbulence levels."

**Screen recording:**
- Demonstrate globe interaction
- Click on airports
- Show control panel features

**Script:**
"Congratulations! You've just set up a complete full-stack web application with real-time data integration and 3D visualization. This is seriously impressive work - you should be proud!"

1. **Use high resolution** (1080p minimum)
2. **Record each terminal window separately** for clarity
3. **Pause between major steps** to let viewers catch up
4. **Zoom in on important text** (command outputs, error messages)
5. **Use cursor highlighting** to show where you're clicking

### Post-Production:
- **Add captions** for accessibility
- **Include timestamps** in description
- **Add visual callouts** for important steps
- **Create chapter markers** for easy navigation

### Supplementary Materials:
- **Pinned comment** with all commands listed
- **Links to troubleshooting guides**
- **GitHub repository link**
- **Timestamp index** for quick navigation
