# 2025 Summer Internship project: Airport Turbulence Visualization Apps

This is a test to produce NASA WorldWind web apps entirely developed via AI agents.

- Each directory contains an app that was developed with the platform stated in the directory name.
- Please note that these apps have not been reviewed by human coders to clear them out of hallucinations, wrong assumptions, and redundancies.
- The `Original Python script and example data` directory has a human-developed script that consults the API from https://aviationweather.gov/api/data/metar. It also contains example .kml data that's produced by the script. This was used as input data for the models to generate the apps.
